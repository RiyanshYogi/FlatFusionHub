FlatFusionHub, a web app project that is based on MERN stack and ML/DL + MLOps!
In today`s world where Flats/Apartments are difficult to find, this web app will help users to find them even at cheaper rates.

This Project consists of 4 basic components:
1. Frontend
    -In this, we will be using React App, with of HTML, CSS and Javascript included.
    -We will be adding Buying, Selling and Renting feature into this webapp.
    -Also comparision of various flats/apartments will be  according to user preference in the near future.
    -Users will be able to view Apartments/Flats for buying or rent. 
    -Whereas for additional purposes like getting more details about the apartments/flats or getting related information or even Selling any Apartment/Flat they will have to Login/SignIn for authentication.

2. Backend
    -We will use Nodejs as a backend technology where we will be using different APIs, middleware, methods to create a functional website. 
    -The authentication functionality will be fulfilled by using JWT(JSONWebToken) and cookies will be used for better User Experience.

3. Database
    -Database is one of the most important component of any webapp, we will be using MongoDB for database Entries.
    -Tables created will be:
        APARTMENT/FLAT FOR SELL/RENT
		Entries in db:
			Type of User
			Name
			Mobile No.
			Email
			Property for (sell/rent)
			Property Type
			City
			Locality
			Furnishing details
		Entries for predicting rate 

	APARTMENT/FLAT FOR RENT
		Entries in db: 
			Flat No. 
			BHK
			Rent
			Total Floor
			Current Floor
			Area Locality
			City
			Furnishing status
			Preferred Tenants
			Bathroom
			Point of contact
		Entries for predicting rent:
			BHK	
			Size
			Area Locality
			Current Floor
			City
			Furnishing status
			Preferred tenants
			Bathroom

	APARTMENT/FLAT TO BUY
			Entries in db:
			Entries for predicting amount:

	LOGS
		Entry every time we hit any API:
			url
			method
			ipAddress

	USER INFORMATION
		Entries in db:
			Name
			Age
			Email
			Phone No.
4. ML/DL + MLOps
- Obtain authentic datasets from Kaggle.
- Implement ML/DL algorithms for model training.
- Utilize ML Ops for various stages: data preparation, training, evolution, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment.
- Leverage libraries such as Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras for development.
